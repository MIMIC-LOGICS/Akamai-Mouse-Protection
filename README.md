# Akamai-Mouse-Protection

# Description

This is a POC of a Biometric Antibot Solution to stop mouse data generated by bots. This POC only works for the mouse movement generator shared in `src/old_mact.py`, and should not used for any other scope. The training data has not been shared, but only the polished model.

To know more about the implementation, please refer to the blog post [here](https://atlaslogics.github.io).

# Usage

Be sure to load the `predictor.py` in a new virtual environment as the joblib library might not work as expected.

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

python predictor.py
```
